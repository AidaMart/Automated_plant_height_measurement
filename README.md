### Automated_plant_height_measurement

PlantHeight.ipynb file includes code by which one can measure the plant's height without any physical tools, automated. It is done by Image Processing, using the OpenCV library. One need to choose some fixed object, provide its width, and the algorithm will do comparisons with the given object's height and will measure the given plant's height. For testing, I used the wheat seeds that I graw in soil. The picture which I used is provided under flower.jpeg file.
